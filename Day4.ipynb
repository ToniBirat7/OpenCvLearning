    "### Smoothing Images\n",
    "\n",
    "Process of removing noise in the image is called Smoothing Image.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Smoothing` image is also `preprocessing` for edge detection, feature extraction and other image analysis techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Noise** : Random variations in pixel intensity values that distort the visual information in the image. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Causes of Noise\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sensor Limitations:** Imperfections in the camera sensor, such as thermal noise or shot noise, contribute to noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Low Light Conditions:** Higher gain settings or ISO can amplify sensor noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transmission Errors:** Noise can occur during image transmission over communication channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of Noise\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gaussian Noise (Additive White Gaussian Noise - AWGN)** : Noise values follow a Gaussian (normal) distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically : I<sub>Noise</sub>*(x,y)* = *I(x,y)+N(x,y)*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Salt-and-Pepper Noise** : Pixels are randomly replaced with either minimum intensity (black) or maximum intensity (white).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Convolution and Matrix Multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "**Convolution** : At each step, the kernel and the corresponding submatrix of the image are multiplied element-wise, and the results are summed to produce a `single output value`. The result of the convolution is applied to single pixel i.e. centered pixel. Therefore, padding is required if we want to apply make border smooth (blur).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Matrix Multiplication** : mXn * nXm -> m*m as output matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Filters (Kernel)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a matrix that runs of the over the original image pixels. We use `cv.filter()` to convolve a `kernel` with an image. \n",
    "\n",
    "The shape of the kernel should be an odd number. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Types of Filters or Kernels**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Low-pass Filter** : Remove noise\n",
    "\n",
    "**High-pass Filter** : Edge Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Types of Smoothing (Blurring)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Image blurring is achieved by convolving the image with a low-pass filter kernel. It is useful for removing noise. It actually removes high frequency content (eg: noise, edges) from the image. So edges are blurred a little bit in this operation (there are also blurring techniques which don't blur the edges). OpenCV provides four main types of blurring techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Averaging** : This is done by `convolving` an image with a normalized box filter. It simply takes the average of all the pixels under the kernel area and replaces the `central` element. This is done by the function `cv.blur()` or `cv.boxFilter()`. We should specify the width and height of the kernel. A 3x3 normalized box filter would look like the below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='./Notes_Images/average_kernel.png' width=100 height=100>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gussian Blur** : In this method, instead of a box filter, a Gaussian kernel(it is small than filter) is used. It is done with the function, `cv.GaussianBlur()`. We should specify the width and height of the kernel which should be positive and odd. \n",
    "\n",
    "It works by averaging the pixels in the image based on a Gaussian function (which is a bell-shaped curve) to create a smoothing effect. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='./Notes_Images/G1.png' width=600 height=600>\n",
    "<img src='./Notes_Images/G2.png' width=600 height=600>\n",
    "<img src='./Notes_Images/G3.png' width=600 height=600>\n",
    "\n",
    "To normalize the final output(output after convolution) we divide the output by the sum of all the element in the kernel that was created.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, `kernel` created contains the normally distributed data i.e. with `σ=1`. We can pass the `σ` we want in the kernel and the kernel will be created to match the `σ` we've passed. Pixels near to central pixel are assigned closer weight to that of central pixel and vice versa for pixels far from the central pixel. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Normalizing is Important?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalization in the Gaussian blur process is essential for maintaining the overall brightness (intensity levels) of the image. Without normalization, the resulting image would either become too bright or too dark. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we do not apply normalization the pixel value might become unrealistic high or low therefore, to solve this we need to normalize the value after convolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creation of Gussian Kernel using Gussian Function**\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='./Notes_Images/K1.png' width=600 height=600>\n",
    "<img src='./Notes_Images/K2.png' width=500 height=500>\n",
    "<img src='./Notes_Images/K3.png' width=600 height=600>\n",
    "\n",
    "Gussian Blur smoothens the extreme pixels as well because the image before convolution is added padding to the original. Due to padding, the border also gets smooth. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we do not want to blur the edges we can `BilateralFiltering`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Bilateral Filtering**\n",
    "\n",
    "Exactly similar to `GussianBlur` but Edges are preserved because pixels with significantly different intensities (on opposite sides of an edge) are assigned very low weights. We already saw that a Gaussian filter takes the neighbourhood around the pixel and finds its `Gaussian weighted average`.\n",
    "\n",
